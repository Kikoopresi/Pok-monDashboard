# PokemonDashboard
A small project done in Tableau Public and PowerBI, showcasing two different dashboard regarding the Pok√©mon franchise. It comprises 8 genarations, with their stats, typing and other curious facts.


Tableau Dashboard:
A more simplistic dashboard, that can be used to gain knowledge of pokemon stats and type, while being able to adjust some variables in order to narrow down results or to draw relevant insights. It contains Pokemon distribution by total stats, and segmented by specific stats. Also contains a chart that showcases Pokemon typing, being able to search for specific mons by their typing.


PowerBI Dashboard:
An improved version of the other dashboard, using tooltips and other more technical features of the tool. In addition to the "Overview" page, where we have a broader view of Pokemon stats by typing and generation, along other filters. It serves to compare different generations average stats, as well as average stats by typing. Here, we can see that panning in a specific pokemon name, it will open a small tooltip containing more information about it.
The main feature of this dashboard is the "Pokedex" tab, where we can search for any pokemon up until generation 8, where he can see all the relevant information about a specific pokemon.


These are my first dashboards, made purely for learning how to deal with these tools and to put a bit of practice into them. Although not perfect (and all advices and critiques are welcome), I will try to publish similar dashboards or projects about topics that I like and identify with, not having a particular practical insight in professional terms.
